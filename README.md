**Implementation of Simple Keylogger**

**Objective:**
Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. 
Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. 
Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

**Procedure:**
This Python script implements a basic keylogger using the pynput library. 
It listens for keyboard events and logs each pressed key into a text file named "keylog.txt". 
The script runs indefinitely until stopped, capturing keystrokes in real-time.

**Note:** 
Before running this script, ensure that the pynput library is installed.
If it's not installed, you can do so using the command pip install pynput.

When running this script in IDLE or Jupyter Notebook, to terminate the program, you need to first close the "keylog.txt" file 
and then either press Ctrl+C in IDLE or restart the kernel in Jupyter Notebook. 
This sequence ensures proper termination of the keylogger and saves the logged keystrokes before exiting.
